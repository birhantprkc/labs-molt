"""vLLM weight refit for the FSDP2/AutoModel backend.

One module owns the two refit-time decisions the sender makes per parameter:

* *which* state-dict entries to push (``should_refit_state_dict_entry`` /
  ``state_dict_parameter_trainability``) — skip frozen VLM visual params and the
  non-trainable buffers vLLM already has from the base checkpoint;
* *how* to materialize each one (``gather_full_param``) — under FSDP2, params are
  ``DTensor`` instances whose ``.full_tensor()`` gathers the unsharded tensor
  across both FSDP shard and TP shard dims in one call.

The receiver-side plumbing in ``trainer/workers/policy_actor.py`` (a packed NCCL
broadcast of many weights at once, paired with the vLLM ``update_weights_packed``
RPC) is unchanged — only the *gather* step swaps in.

    Returns ``(full_tensor, full_shape)`` where ``full_tensor`` is on the local
    device with all mesh dims gathered. For non-DTensor params (e.g., the value
    head we don't shard, or buffers), returns ``(param.data, param.shape)``.

    Caller invokes this on each rank; ``full_tensor`` is replicated. Memory cost
    is the size of the full tensor on every participating rank — acceptable for
    weight refit (one-shot per training step). For very large models the async RL
    path uses per-tensor streaming with a ping-pong buffer to bound peak memory.

        ``metas`` is a list of ``(name, dtype, shape)``. Producer (rank 0 in
        the trainer) cats all tensors into a single uint8 buffer in the same
        order; here we split + reinterpret-cast back. Replaces thousands of
        per-tensor RPC+broadcast pairs with a handful of ~1 GiB ones.

        Dtype-faithful: each meta carries the sender's own per-param dtype, which
        may differ from ``model_config.dtype`` (e.g. an fp32-kept MoE router/gate).
        We reconstruct each tensor at its *sent* dtype
        (per-meta ``dtype.itemsize`` / ``view(dtype)``) and hand it to vLLM's
        ``load_weights``, which casts to that param's target dtype via
        ``param.data.copy_()``. We must therefore NOT assert a single uniform dtype
        here — the old assert forced every weight through bf16 and silently
        downcast fp32-kept params, corrupting routing.

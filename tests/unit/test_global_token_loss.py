"""slime-style global token-mean normalization for the RL policy loss.

The RL trainer feeds every microbatch of one optimizer-step batch the *same*
``batch_num_tokens`` (the action-token count of the whole batch, summed over all
microbatches and DP ranks) and skips the ``/accum`` rescale. Summing the
per-microbatch ``agg_loss`` over the window therefore yields slime's
``calculate_per_token_loss=True`` objective: ``Σ (loss*mask).sum() / Σ mask.sum()``.

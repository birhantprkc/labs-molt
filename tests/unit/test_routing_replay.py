"""R3 rollout routing replay — capture alignment + training-side resharding.

The CP-sharded path needs a real process group (exercised by the 4-node run); here
we cover the pure logic: how the rollout per-token expert ids are captured onto a
Trajectory, survive the Experience pad/concat machinery, and get reshaped to the
gate's token order for the non-CP regimes.
